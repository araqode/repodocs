# **App Name**: RepoDocs

## Core Features:

- Repository Fetch: Fetches the content of a Github repository, given a valid repository URL.
- Documentation Generation: Generates a comprehensive project technical documentation from the fetched repository contents, using an LLM to act as a documentation tool. Ensure proper linking and relation mapping between files and documentation parts.
- Documentation Display: Displays the generated documentation in a well-formatted, readable manner.
- Download Documentation: Allows users to download the documentation in various formats (e.g., PDF, Markdown).
- Error Handling: Shows any error messages or warnings encountered during fetching or documentation generation.
- Customizable Formatting: Allow user to specify documentation format like headings, styles etc.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Subtle blue (#6699CC) to convey trust and clarity, inspired by the technical nature of documentation.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), of the same hue as the primary, is a neutral background that ensures readability.
- Accent color: Muted green (#8FBC8F), an analogous color, will be used for interactive elements such as buttons and links.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif font for a computerized, techy feel, and body text: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets within the documentation.
- Clean, structured layout with clear sections for different parts of the documentation. Use of whitespace to improve readability.
- Simple, consistent icons to represent different documentation sections or file types.
- Show inline hrefs/links using dashed-underline for documentation to file mapping
